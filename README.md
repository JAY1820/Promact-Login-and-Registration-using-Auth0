# Promact-Login-and-Registration-using-Auth0

## Description

This repository offers an efficient implementation for incorporating user login and registration features into your application. It seamlessly integrates Auth0 and Microsoft Identity for robust authentication capabilities, ensuring a secure user experience.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Auth0 serves as a centralized authentication platform, managing user login, password operations, and token issuance.
- **Flexible Login Options**: Users can authenticate using Auth0 credentials or their Microsoft account, providing convenient choices.
- **Enhanced Security**: Microsoft Identity follows industry-standard security protocols, ensuring the safety of user data and application integrity.
- **Customization Potential**: The codebase provides a foundation for tailoring the login and registration flow to your specific requirements.

## Prerequisites

- An Auth0 account and application
- A Microsoft Azure subscription
- Basic familiarity with web development concepts

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jay1820/Promact-Login-and-Registration-using-Auth0.git
```

Install required dependencies:

```bash
cd Promact-Login-and-Registration-using-Auth0
npm install
npm run start
```

## Login and Registration Flow

1. **Login**: Users can log in using their Auth0 credentials or their Microsoft account. The login process is handled by Auth0, issuing an access token upon successful authentication.

*Note: Users are required to log in with their GitHub account on the site to access the Microsoft Enterprise.*

2. **Sign Up**: New users can sign up using their email address and password. Auth0 manages the registration process and securely stores user credentials.

3. **Logout**: Users can log out of the application, terminating their session.

## Configuration

### 1. Auth0

Replace placeholders in `src/config.js` with your Auth0 domain, client ID, and client secret.

### 2. Microsoft Azure

Create an Azure Active Directory (AAD) application and configure the following settings:
- Redirect URI: Match the value specified in `src/config.js`
- Supported account types: Select appropriate options (e.g., accounts in any organizational directory)

## Customization

This codebase serves as a starting point for implementing user authentication in your application. Customize the login and registration flow, add additional authentication providers, and integrate other features as needed.
